# TenthStreetStudioBuildingWomenDataset
Expanding the minimal information provided by annual directory
data, the Tenth Street Studio Building Women Dataset captures birthdate and death
date information, if available; identifies any connections to other tenants of the
Studio Building; and compiles a list of years that each woman registered the Studio
Building as her address in city or professional directories. This dataset informs the Mining @ Tenth Street Project and an article about the Tenth Street Studio Building, published by Panorama: Journal of the Historians of American Art, see: Mary Okin with Celie Mitchard, “From Center to Periphery: The Lifespan of New York City’s Tenth Street Studio Building and the Canon of American Art,” Panorama: Journal of the Association of Historians of American Art 8, no. 2 (Fall 2022), https://journalpanorama.org/article/from-center-to-periphery/.
